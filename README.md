I'm currently studying for a master's degree in Computer Science.
Still as a pre-graduate student I got into cryptocurrencies and started posting on Steemit.
And I'm still posting articles, be it tutorials for Languages and specific Libraries/Frameworks, which are related to Computer Science, or Mathematics and Physics...I got you covered!

Because of some stuff that happened on Steemit, I'm now following the Hive fork. Thus, you can find me posting over on [PeakD](https://peakd.com/@drifter1).

My current Repositories are the following (in no particular order):
- [/blockchain](https://github.com/drifter1/blockchain) : Education Python Implementation of a Blockchain
- [/compiler](https://github.com/drifter1/compiler) : Simplified-C Compiler in C using Flex and Bison
- [/circuitsim](https://github.com/drifter1/circuitsim) : Electronic Circuit Simulator
- [/mod2linematrixmul](https://github.com/drifter1/mod2linematrixmul) : VHDL Implementation of Modulo2 Line by Matrix Multiplication 
- [/javagraphalgorithms](https://github.com/drifter1/javagraphalgorithms) : Various Graph Algorithms implemented in Java
- [/openmptutorials](https://github.com/drifter1/openmptutorials) : Tutorial code on the OpenMP Parallel Computing API
- [/cudatutorials](https://github.com/drifter1/cudatutorials) : Tutorial code on Nvidia's CUDA API

I'm also currently setting up a Github-pages page using Jekyll:
